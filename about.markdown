## About
# Hi! I'm Carlos Gerez. 
From a young age, I have been passionate about innovation and problem-solving. My journey in programming began in the 1990s in my home country, Uruguay, where I developed a structured approach to tackling challenges and finding solutions learnig programming languages like COBOL, Turbo Pascal, RPG II.
I recently earned a Bachelor of Science in Applied Technology from BYU-Idaho, where I developed further my skills in software development, web technologies, machine learning, and AI neural networks. I also gained hands-on experience in network management and configuration, through virtual environments orchestration and collaborating with teams to build networks and manage configuration and security.
I thrive on continuous learning and adaptability. Fluent in three languages ( Spanish, English and Norwegian), I understand that communication whether through spoken words or programming languages is key to collaboration and innovation. I have a perspective from years of experience working in teams in different environments, and love to get to know diferent people since I know that bring always new ways to solve problems and see life. 
I am excited to leverage my expertise to drive technology forward and create solutions that foster efficiency, connectivity, and progress while working in team oriented projects.
