Youâ€™ll find in this area projects related to Infrastructure as Code. Vagrant files, Puppet, Ansible, and Kubernetes deployments.

I developed a personal project dedicated to test a network environment developed with Vagrant files and using puppet for deployment of a database for a Q2A app with a load balancer and 2 servers. [Look here for the code] [vagrant-project].
